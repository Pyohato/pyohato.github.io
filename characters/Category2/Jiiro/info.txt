Young and energetic, though a little naive. Jiiro is Valentiro's self-appointed "side-kick". He's a tengu, and fell into the Memento forest from the sky on his way home from school. Sometimes hangs out and drinks with Lienzo and Roulette (don't tell Morrigan). Seems to be friendly and well mannered actually, if not a little dense at times. Tries hard to impress Valentiro and his fellow tengu! But...he's a little...small looking for a tengu isnt he..?
