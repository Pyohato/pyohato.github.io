Don of the Crow Mafia. Morrigan is a well known and highly respected, yet feared, individual. They offer services of protection and assasination and often keeps the general order of Memento forest in line. Used to live in Houtengoku. A very stoic and mysterious crow. Uses rifles. Owns a bar and babysits Raakugaki while there. Always seen carrying lollipop, but used to smoke. This was a substitute reccomended by someone who is the most close to her.
Her design is based on Jackdaw crow.
