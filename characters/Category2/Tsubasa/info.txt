A very anxious and timid young boy. Cranes are associated with good fortune and prosperity on Houtengoku, but Tsubasa is only a small and meek little crane. They are reclusive and spends most of their time writing or playing video games. But still has a dream to work in the postal service. His anxieties prevent him from leaving the house... Has recently been sending letters to a pen-pal in a similar situation.
Very very shy.
