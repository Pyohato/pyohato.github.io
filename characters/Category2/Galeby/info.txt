Well mannered, cute, polite and responsible! Galeby is the model employee for working in the airmail service. She's always on time and often supervises trainees who are new to the job. Though, some test her patience more than others. She loves sailing and looking at the ocean in her spare time. Despite being mature, she still loves splashing in puddles when it rains. Often mistaken to be a seagull...
Her design is based on Albatross.
