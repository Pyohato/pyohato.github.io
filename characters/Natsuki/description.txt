Moon rabbit, quiet, cute and strong. Natsuki is just like any of the other lunar rabbits who spend their days pounding mochi and caring for the delicate land of Earth's moon. She seems to be mostly emotionless, stoic and its hard to read what she's thinking. But she cares a lot for the Luna Princess and wants nothing more than to help her. She's easily determined and very quick to jump into action... A little strange, this one. Unique.
Afraid of water.
