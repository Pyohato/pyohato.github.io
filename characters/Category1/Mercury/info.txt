Irritable and wanting to just be left alone to read their books, Mercury can't quite live this life with social butterflies Mars and Venus on their shoulders. They own the largest collection of books in the universe and has a grande library in their underground city. They are quick to change from calm to hot-blodded. Despite having a hard outer shell of a personality, they do have genuine love and conern for their friends. Very responsible. Their relationship with Mars is like Boke and Tsukkomi.
Also speaks in kansai accent.
