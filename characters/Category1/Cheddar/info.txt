An astray, fallen Protostar. The crash landing gave them strange, and physically  impossible, holes in their hair. They claim to not remember their name or where they came from, so until they find a way back; Natsuki has given them the name <b>Cheddar.</b> They really like it. A little on the over-confident and lacking any sense of danger side, but a caring little being.
Scared of growing up..
