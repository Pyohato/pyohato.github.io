A talented young moon and the third child of the Saturn family ensemble. Plays the Violin. Often left with the task of representing planet Saturn while their parental figure is away. Seems to be smart, strict and poise. Though this is just an act. They are quite insecure and ditzy actually, and don't get out much. Wishes to learn the sword someday and be as efficient as Jupiter or Venus!
Used to have much longer hair.
