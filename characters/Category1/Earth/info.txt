Despite being the most inhabited planet in the entire galaxy, not many people have met Earth. Full of mystery. But always reverred as the most loving and polite planet of them all. Some say its a blessing to be in their presence. They love humans and everything about life... even if  those things may be making their health deteriorate little by little over time...
A beloved wife!
